# MatrixAlgebra
MatrixAlgebra expands on the basic Java Calculator concept. As a first project, it was started and developed prior to having exposure to concepts such as class diagrams, test driven development, and without professional direction regarding style guidelines (specifically, the GUI could use a major makeover.)

I plan to refactor the GUI this weekend or the next. Until then, please excuse the spaghetti code, incomplete classes, etc. Sometimes, in order to learn how to develop software, it's equally important to learn how <b>not</b> to develop it.

Per the name, the goal is to eventually incorporate a Matrix wrapper class and some basic functions.
